# DesafioSwift

Reddit Client

Client of Reddit that shows only the first 25 entries of the web page including the next features:

* Title
* Author
* Date of the entry
* Thumbnail, in case of existing.
* Number of comments
* Subreddits

The app works without internet because it uses CoreData to store some of the reddits. It should be noted that the reddits displayed in this case were not updated.
